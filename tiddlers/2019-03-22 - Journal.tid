08:52 - Noticed a Wi-fi calling issue this morning, took one regular restart, one force restarted, and turning off cellular, wi-fi, bluetooth, and wi-fi calling then enabling cellular, wi-fi, then wi-fi calling all thirty seconds apart and finally Wi-fi calling is working again. Wi-fi calling was working last night, and last night no carrier update or iOS update was installed and the last time I restarted my device was Sunday. WTF!

09:11 - Listening to [[Core Intuition Ep. 365|https://coreint.org/2019/03/episode-365-a-pretty-big-update/]].

10:59 - Looks like Wi-fi calling is not working again, and the previous fix isn't solving the issue this time. ðŸ˜¡

11:00 - Listening to [[A Slab of Glass Ep. 26|https://aslabofglass.com/26]].

14:57 - And the WiFi calling issue has magically fixed itself.
