09:03 - Testing using Evernote again, and I realize why I liked it for so long, all the integrations with IFTTT, Zapier, and other services make it easy to add things. Really need TheBrain 11 beta to come out soon, so that I can stop this downfall into Evernote.

09:27 - Adding icons to tags in the wiki, I like them. Thanks to [[Nucleo]] I have thousands of options to chose from.

17:36 - Had a cookout with the SO's family, it was delicious.

18:57 - Changed the [[blog|https://blog.joshsullivan.io]] back to a light theme, light themes seem much cleaner to me.
