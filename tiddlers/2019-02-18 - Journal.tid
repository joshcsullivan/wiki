07:03 - I somehow missed in the forecast how much snow would be on the ground this morning. Probably about 3 inches right now, with the wind its drifting in areas up to 2 feet.

08:49 - Trying to decide whether to post code snippets as [[Carbonize]] exports and add a link to a GitHub gist for easy copying and pasting of the code. Posted to [[Micro.blog]] asking for [[opinions|https://micro.blog/joshsullivan/2365501]].
