title: Self-Hosting Adventure
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

I've been on a host it yourself kick for the last 10 months ever since I had a data loss that was semi hard to recover from. [[NextCloud]] has been integral in this effort. I'm currently using it for:

* File Sync
* Bookmarks
* Contacts
* DEVONthink WebDAV Sync
* Standard Notes File Safe Location
* Cryptomator Vault Sync Location

There are now three services I use that I do not self-host: 

* Standard Notes (Versions cannot be used with Self-Hosted Sync Server Currently)
* TheBrain
* 1Password
** I've tried BitWarden and think it's great, but I like 1Password more, seems more polished.
