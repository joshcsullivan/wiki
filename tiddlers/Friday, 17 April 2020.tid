Currently living in Excel hell. Trying to prepare about 40,000 accounts for the Microsoft licensing change that is coming over the summer. I do most of my CSV work in NotePad++, but sometimes it isn't enough and Excel is the only option. ðŸ˜ 

I really like the active community around [[Joplin]] but the drawbacks are too much for me. I still read the [[forum|https://discourse.joplinapp.org/]] daily, as it often has good resources for note taking and organization.
