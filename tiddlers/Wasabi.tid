[[Wasabi|https://wasabi.com/]] is S3 compliant storage. It is incredibly cheap for $5 for 1TB or less, which I am definitely under.

I am currently using it for hosting my blog and wiki images and any downloads I need to share. I also use it with [[Dropshare]].

I also have [[this wiki backing up to it|TW: Wiki Backup]].
