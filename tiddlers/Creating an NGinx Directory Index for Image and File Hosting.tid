title: Creating an NGinx Directory Index for Image and File Hosting
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Due to [[Phil's|Phil Nunnally]] post on his wiki about [[Self Hosting Images|https://youneedastereo.com/#how%20I%20self-host%20images%20in%20this%20wiki]] I reached out to him how he had set it up and then realized I had already done something similar but forgot about it.

I'm listing out the steps I took to set up the NGinx Directory Index Listing.

On a DigitalOcean droplet (or any Ubuntu/Linux VPS) already set up with Nginx, follow these steps:

# Get a domain or subdomain for the new site. In this example I used static.domain.com
# To restrict it you can create a new folder in the home directory of your user profile, for example mine is `/home/josh/public` 
# While SSH'd into the VPS, navigate to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` then created the `static.domain.com` by entering (or another text editor) `sudo nano static.domain.com`
# In the File put the following (make sure to change the path in root to your path)<span>

```
server {
        server_name static.domain.com;
        root /home/josh/public;
        autoindex on;
        autoindex_exact_size off;
        autoindex_format html;
        autoindex_localtime on; 
}
```
</span>


# Next you need to enable the site via Symbolic link: `sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/static.domain.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ - Symbolic links site to enabled`
# For an SSL Cert if you have cert bot install you can skip to step 9, otherwise continue to 7
# Enter `sudo apt install certbot - Install Certbot`
# Enter `sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx` - Installs Nginx Certbot
# Enter `sudo certbot --nginx` - Create HTTPS cert with Letâ€™s Encrypt
# Select whichever domains you want your cert to cover
# Press 2 to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, this is recommended - The conf files for your selected domains will be updated with the cert information automatically

You should now be able to access your NGinx directory index at `static.domain.com`
