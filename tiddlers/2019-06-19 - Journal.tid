06:41 - I've been absent from the wiki a lot. More a statement of how busy I've been then not wanting to post. Although in my limited free time I did spend it creating a [[Hugo site|https://joshsullivan.io]] instead of adding content here. Hope to be more active here now.

06:43 - Last night on the train ride home I listened to the newest [[Micro Monday Podcast|https://monday.micro.blog/2019/06/17/episode-customise-your.html]] with [[Miraz Jordan|https://micro.blog/miraz]] who was taking about her [[new site with tutorials|https://custom.micro.blog]] on the new Hugo based Micro.blog themes. I learned about CSS/HTML exclusively through the web inspector by breaking things and seeing what happened when I commented out an element. I like learning with more hands on interaction rather than verbal instruction, so the web inspector is a great tool for me.
