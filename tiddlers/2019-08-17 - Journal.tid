07:16 - I enjoy laying in bed reading the Todoist, GTD, and Productivity subreddits. I donâ€™t get to do it during weekdays so I make the most of it on the weekends.

20:32 - Reading forums posts about recovering data from folder directories and not true backups, make me glad I'm so obsessive about backups. If TheBrain, DEVONthink, or InfoQube crashed and killed my local backups somehow, I still have them backing up to 3 different cloud services. I download a copy of the data every 2 weeks and test to make sure the backup works.
