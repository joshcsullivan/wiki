08:37 - Finding myself turning more and more to self hosted solutions other than [[TheBrain]]. [[DEVONthink]] has become my document and bookmark manager with TheBrain being my read later list.

10:30 - Went back and changed the change log in the wiki to match creation dates with their actual created dates. Also changed the Palette for the wiki because I prefer dark palettes.

11:20 - Life is slowing down again. Work was crazy for about a month and a half, personal life was getting crazy with a bunch of good changes, but I didn't really have time for myself. Thankfully now I'm getting back into the things I enjoy and relieve stress, like this wiki and my blog.

13:55 - I put in a ticket with TheBrain support due to sluggish UI issues. Changing the note panel size is ridiculously clunky and searching/opening thoughts are a little slow. On Windows it works completely smooth, so hopefully something they can fix.
