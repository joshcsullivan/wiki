04:39 - Long weekend for me. Starting off my changing [[TheBrain]] keyboard shortcuts to meld with how I use other keyboard shortcuts.

05:31 - I keep looking at this [[Intel NUC|https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc/kits/nuc8i7hvk.html]]. I almost buy it every weekend, my plan is to set it up as a Linux server at home and create a couple VMs on it with snapshot backups to my Synology. ðŸ¤”

07:04 - I've switched to using [[TheBrain]] for my read later list and so far it's been great.
