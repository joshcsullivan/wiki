Feedbin now has a read later feature. This enables you to send articles and webpages from anywhere and have them appear alongside your feeds, email newsletters and Twitter subscriptions. Itâ€™s called Pages.

Feedbin released an update today to allow you to collect links from around the internet to read later in Feedbin. I'll definitely be trying it out, I keep going from DEVONthink to Todoist for a read later service. In DEVONthink, I collect the bookmarks and in Todoist, add a task to a Read Later project with a link to the site. I think this will be a much better fit, as I do a lot of reading inside Feedbin anyways.
