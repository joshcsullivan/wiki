I recently found out that TiddlyWiki doesn't have the ability to update links within Tiddlers if a name of the linked Tiddler is changed.

Thanks to [[this GG thread|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/Y1V7oyBLpSs/9ZZFF0IGG8MJ]] I found a way to link with the name of the tiddler still usable and even if the name changes the link will still stay.

Originally I was going to create a UUID field for the tiddler then link to that UUID, but I was going to use the date created instead of trying to create a completely unique identifier because it's easier to keep track of and due to TiddlyWiki recording down to the millisecond it is highly unlikely that ''I''<<footnote "Me, Myself, and I">> will ever create two Tiddlers at exactly the same time.

# Copy the created value, found in Info.
# In the tiddler you want to link from, you paste one of the following options:

```
<$list filter=[field:created[YOUR_UUID_VALUE_GOES_HERE]!has[draft.of]] />
```
```
{{{ [field:created[YOUR_UUID_VALUE_GOES_HERE]!has[draft.of]] }}}
```

Next I created [[TextExpander]] snippet with `{{{ [field:created[CLIPBOARD]!has[draft.of]] }}}` now I can copy the date created from the Tiddler, go to the new tiddler and type the snippet abbreviation and the link is created and stays through Tiddler renames.
