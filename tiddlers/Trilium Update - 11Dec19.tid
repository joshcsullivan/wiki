title: Trilium Update - 11Dec19
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Migrated and combined all notes, personal and work related into [[Trilium]] over the last couple days. I've seen no slow down at all, with >700 notes in it, I'm really happy. Also I've been posting questions to the [[GitHub Issues|https://github.com/zadam/trilium/issues]] and getting responses incredibly quick, and even got a feature added for the next version. I really like small development houses, Trilium is one person, and they are great at customer support and building an amazing product.
