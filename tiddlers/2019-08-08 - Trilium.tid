type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

[[Trilium|https://github.com/zadam/trilium]] is an open source, note application. You can run it locally, or via a server.

I've set up a Docker container on my Docker VPS and am testing it out. So far I like it, although I would prefer markdown links, hyper links still work.
