title: Moving Isso Comment Database to New Server
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

If you are moving your Isso database to a new server, you can just copy the .db and .conf file to the new server then run the following to change the owner and group:

```
sudo chown username:username comments.db
```

Run this for both the .conf and .db file otherwise there might be errors.
