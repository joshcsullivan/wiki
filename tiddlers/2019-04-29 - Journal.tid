⛅ 43-59ºF

07:33 - I had to take the commuter rail in today because I am working later than the boats run and I'd rather walk to Boston than drive into the city. I walked up from South Station to my building and enjoyed the lovely weather.

08:42 - Thinking of purchasing a 32-inch 4K monitors for my Mac Pro at home. I really want better resolution and want a bigger screen and 32-inches would be perfect. We will see.

19:22 - Long day today due to coverage of final exams in the Law School. At least I'm getting a bunch of old notes out of a FileMaker Pro Database and into my DEVONthink database.
