08:40 - Due to [[Jack Baty]]'s [[post about web pages|https://micro.blog/joshsullivan/2480244]] I am thinking of how to be a better web citizen and whether than means linking to sites that don't have auto play videos and popups to sign up.

10:36 - Finished copying all the entries from my DokuWiki instance over to this wiki. I'll be shutting it down shortly then redirecting the domain to joshisms.io

13:01 - I'm looking into [[Raindrop.io|https://raindrop.io]]. It's an interesting tool that might combine my use of [[Pocket|https://getpocket.com/]] and media gathering. I'm still using Pinboard for bookmarking and archiving, Pocket is used for read later.
