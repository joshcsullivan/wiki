An open source note taking and to-do application with synchronisation capabilities
<<<

I've tried Joplin a few times and keep leaving it. It's a great note taking application with multiple syncing options. I do like Joplin but I need the cons to be sorted out first.

Here is what I like and dislike:

!! Pros:
* Native Markdown and preview support
* Sync Encryption
** Not by default, but can be set up easily
* Code Block Syntax Highlighting

!! Cons:
* Tags appear to be an after thought implementation
* Search Doesn't Include Wildcard support at the beginning of a word
** ~~Ex. `*bear` wouldn't find unbearable~~
** After a recent update, `bear*` will now find unbearable, I still prefer the wildcard support to allow for prefix
* ''There is no way to lock or protect Joplin on a desktop install''
** This wouldn't be so much of an issue if I split personal from work notes, but some of my work notes turn into personal notes or vice versa so it is easier to keep it in one repository. I don't want a coworker to be able to sign into my profile and see all of my notes.
