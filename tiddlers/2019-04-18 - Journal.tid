08:19 - Started using TheBrain to store my processing rules information and the tools I use. i.e. Note taking is the parent of [[Drafts]], [[Dynalist]], [[NotePad++]], [[Sublime Text]], and How to Take Smart Notes. Idea came from [[ruddhein on TheBrain Forums|http://forums.thebrain.com/post/what-other-software-do-you-use-noncompeting-8423089?pid=1306323200&random=88818]].

14:30 - Finally took the time to list out all of my subscriptions. About $220 a month for monthly subscriptions and $1,600 a year for all yearly renewals.
