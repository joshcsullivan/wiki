[[Print Friendly|https://www.printfriendly.com/]] is an online service that creates a de-cluttered PDF from a web page. Before exporting to PDF it gives you the option of deleting sections of the text it creates from the web page. I use it all the time to create very simple text PDFs from pages I find while browsing.

I use this service almost every day now and it continues to perform amazingly. It cuts down PDF creation from 6-8MB to .75-1.3MB.
