[[Print Friendly|https://www.printfriendly.com/]] is a online service that creates a de-cluttered PDF from a web page. Before exporting to PDF it gives you the option of deleting sections of the text it creates from the web page. I use it all the time to create very simple text PDFs from pages I find while browsing.
