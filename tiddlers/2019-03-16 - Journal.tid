08:16 - Last night the SO and I watched the first episode of [[Roswell, New Mexico|https://slnks.io/94mib]] for nostalgia reasons and it was okay, not great. Which led us to watch an episode from [[Roswell|https://slnks.io/ehkqj]] and let me just say I am so happy special effects have improved. It was rather painful to watch, but I was surprised to see how many great actors and actresses got there start from that series.
