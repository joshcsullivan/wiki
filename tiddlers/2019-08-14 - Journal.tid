06:26 - Thinking of setting up a [[Discourse instance for comments|https://meta.discourse.org/t/using-discourse-as-a-comment-system/107663]] on my blog. Isso is hard to manage and annoying in regards to replying as the admin.

06:57 - Also thinking of going back to [[Commento|https://commento.io/]] so I donâ€™t have all these issues. ðŸ¤”

10:10 - I put in an issue for threads and admin links for [[Isso Comments]], hoping I get answers on how to set it up for linked domains. I do like how Isso looks and that it is self-hosted.
