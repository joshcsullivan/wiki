[[Victoria|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(UK_TV_series)]]

An enjoyable season, I think I liked the first season better. I did like the episode and references to the [[Great Famine|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)]] as I was worried they might push that aside or skip it altogether.
