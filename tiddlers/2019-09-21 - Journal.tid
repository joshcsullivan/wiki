08:21 - After testing this morning, [[TheBrain 11 Alpha]] is definitely not ready for production Brains. Usually the alphas from TheBrain are really stable and great, but due to all the changes to sync and the Notes editor I can understand why it's not as stable as usual. That said, it's a great start and Markdown notes are fantastic.
