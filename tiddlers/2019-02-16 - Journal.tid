14:09 - I'm really enjoying reading through [[Jack's Wiki|https://rudimentarylathe.org/]] and [[Phil's Wiki|https://twelvety.com/tiddlywiki.html#]]

12:10 - The backup script is working properly, now on to adding content and probably finding more plugins.

08:02 - Set up Github script from [[Jack Baty]] to auto backup TiddlyWiki to Github daily. Tomorrow I'll be able to see if the script ran correctly, currently it is working when manually run.
