title: Wasabi and Synology Hyper Backup
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Somehow I missed that you can use [[Wasabi with Synology Hyper Backup|https://wasabi-support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001684131-How-do-I-use-Synology-with-Wasabi-]].

I use Hyper Backup with external drives and now I can use Wasabi directly from the Synology instead of using Arq.
