08:04 - I switched to oatmeal for breakfast everyday about a month ago. So far its eliminated snacking in the morning as I'm not hungry until 12 P.M., plus it has created a consistent meal schedule which I've never had. I'm hoping this routine change makes it easier to implement a few new habits I hope to form once the weather gets warmer.

08:51 - Sync'd Chrome bookmarks to Safari with [[BookMacster|https://slnks.io/y80db]], definitely one of the more useful tools I only use once a month.

11:23 - [[TheBrain]] sync is down right now. Second time in 2 weeks, I'm hoping it is to improve the responsiveness issues in the web version.
