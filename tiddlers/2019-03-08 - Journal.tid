05:33 - I was promised spring weather by the end of this week and it's still early February weather. ðŸ˜¡

11:25 - Got [[YOURLS]] up and running on a droplet. Biggest issue was getting [[mariabackup|https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/mariabackup-overview/]] installed and running with a cronjob and RClone.

15:16 - I'll be moving the YOURLS service to the server this wiki is on, so the next few hours may be spotty connection to the wiki while I migrate the mysql database and re-assign ports.

18:58 - YOURLS has been moved to my main server. Now the other one is back to a test server. It was a very easy process, thank goodness to SCP on Ubuntu.
