09:34 - I've used Chrome for about 6 months now due to it's cross platform abilities and large extension library. About 2 weeks ago bookmarks got all kinds of out of wack, so today I had some time to try to sort out the problem. After deleting all bookmarks on every device, signing out of Chrome on every device, uninstalling it, running CleanMyMac X and Onyx, then re-installing it and signing in, re-adding bookmarks to one machine bookmarks are now syncing correctly if added. But if I delete a bookmark on a device other than my Mac Pro the Mac Pro doesn't delete the bookmark. ðŸ˜¡

09:39 - In other news, I bought the new [[AirPods|https://slnks.io/60ah9]] so I can't wait for those to arrive.
