12:26 - I've created a second online wiki that is for personal notes and restricted reading and writing to authenticated users. I can use this for personal notes I don't want anyone else accessing. This also gave me a trial run on my documentation of how to set up a TiddlyWiki on DigitalOcean, only missed one command certbot related. So I think after some polishing I should have the instructions up in the next day or two.
