* TheBrain Sync isn't working right now and according to the forums, has been down for over 12 hours. Thankfully I don't need to sync anything, but I'm amazed that it's been down so long without support or the company saying anything. It almost seems like they haven't realized it's down, which is insane, because when one of our servers go down (or high CPU, low memory, low storage, etc), we get an email and text every 5 minutes until it's back up and working as normal.
* Another thing, is that even what disabling Automatic sync, every 2-3 minutes a pop-up appears stating there is a sync issue, which is very disruptive and annoying.
