Yesterday I purchased a license for [[DEVONthink Server 3|https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink/editions]] which comes with 2 seats.

It's a great update and the Server capabilities have been vastly improved. I have DTS3 installed on a Mac I keep in the corner of my Office and remote into for DEVONthink. Now I can keep that Mac running with DTS3 I can navigate to the URL on my Windows machine and use DEVONthink like normal.

Update 27 April 2019 09:59 - I'm trying to purchase a seat for DTS3 and cannot find a way to purchase a single seat after purchasing the license.

Update 27 April 2019 10:27 - [[Jim on DT Forums|https://discourse.devontechnologies.com/t/server-edition/46081/9?u=jcsully217]] replied saying Eric will need to address this issue.

Update 27 April 2019 11:36 - Eric reached out saying they fixed it. I was then able to purchase an extra seat for my laptop. With education pricing, it was <$75. ðŸ˜ƒ
