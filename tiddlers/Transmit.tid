[[Transmit 5|https://panic.com/transmit/]] is great for managing files and upload them. Unfortunately it doesn't allow for editing S3 uploaded file metadata. 

I use [[Wasabi]] for sharing files and hosting images for this wiki and my blog. Transmit allows me easily manage the files in my Wasabisys buckets.
