YOURLS stands for Your Own URL Shortener. It is a small set of PHP scripts that will allow you to run your own URL shortening service (a la TinyURL or Bitly).

Running your own URL shortener is fun, geeky and useful: you own your data and don't depend on third-party services. It's also a great way to add branding to your short URLs, instead of using the same public URL shortener everyone uses.

I'm about to embark on implementing YOURLS so I don't rely on other services, and can use my own domain name.

''Update'': Thanks to [[this tutorial|https://slnks.io/clwzo]] I now have YOURLS up and running.

Installed the following plugins:
