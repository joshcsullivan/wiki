ðŸŒ§ 39-60ÂºF

07:54 - Registration week at a University is hell on IT, this year we changed authentication and added direct access to the registration service and have only had one admin server below 50% available resources. With about 400 people hitting the server with around 2400 requests every 5 minutes for 25 minutes, we are doing great compared to years past.

17:33 - Testing out using Git as a client for [[Blot]]. So far it's been okay, not sure I like how difficult it is to create files on iOS. Working Copy works okay, but it isn't as easy as Dropbox action in Drafts. Still debating.
