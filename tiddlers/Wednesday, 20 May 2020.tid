Just installed the new [[Windows Terminal|https://github.com/microsoft/terminal]] which allows for PowerShell, Command Prompt, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) in a single shell window. It uses tabbed view, so you can have a single window with multiple of each or all opened. I'm really liking it so far.
